## Intelligente Agentes Introduction @ CIn - UFPE 2020.1

### Requirements:
- For python codes use [Processing](https://processing.org/) with [python module](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py).
- For p5.js use web server, a development option is [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
